Demo Credit is a mobile lending app that requires wallet functionality. This is needed as borrowers need a wallet to receive the loans they have been granted and also send the money for repayments. This MVP (Minimum Viable Product)provides endpoints for the following API features;

Features:
* A user can create an account
* A user can transfer funds to another user’s account
* A user can withdraw funds from their account
* An Admin user can aprove loans and credit other users
* A user with records in the Lendsqr Adjutor Karma blacklist is never onboarded.

The Entity Relationship (E-R Diagram) above shows that the different entities of this software includes our Users, Transaction records, Adjutor bvn service and the Admin. The bvn validator and adjutor service makes it possible to detect blacklisted bvn owners and prevent them from accessing our services thereby reducing the risk of non-complaint debtors.<br> <br> The User id is an essential token that is created upon onboarding into the application and is included with every single transaction record on the application incuding the sender and reciever account details, transaction amount and current timestamp. This Services put together implements common wallet / banking processes in the real-world.
